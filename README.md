# Credit Card Fraud Detection using XGBoost

This project predicts whether a given credit card transaction is **Fraud or not Fraud** using the **Machine Learning Algorithm**.  
It also includes a **Streamlit web application** where users can input transaction details and instantly check if the transaction is likely to be fraudulent.

Use the App link to check whether the Transaction is **Fraud or not Fraud**:
